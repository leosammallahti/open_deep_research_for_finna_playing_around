# Deep Research Prompt: Unlocking Advanced Capabilities with TogetherAI's Full Platform

## 1. Project Context

Our project, **Open Deep Research**, is an advanced, open-source AI assistant that automates in-depth research and generates comprehensive reports. It operates in two modes: a sequential, high-quality **Graph-based Workflow** and a parallel, high-efficiency **Multi-Agent Workflow**. We are currently using TogetherAI's serverless API for inference with models like Llama 3.1 and Qwen 1.5.

## 2. Research Objective

This research goes beyond optimizing our existing model usage. The goal is to **discover and devise strategies for integrating TogetherAI's less-obvious and advanced platform features to fundamentally enhance our project's capabilities, efficiency, and the quality of its output.** We want to explore what's possible beyond standard API calls.

## 3. Key Research Questions

Please conduct a deep analysis of TogetherAI's full suite of services and provide a detailed report that addresses the following areas of innovation:

### 3.1. Agentic Capabilities: Code Execution
- **Concept:** Can our researcher agents go beyond searching and writing, to actually *analyzing* data?
- **Inquiry:** Propose a detailed workflow for integrating TogetherAI's **Code Sandbox** or **Code Interpreter** into our researcher agents. Could an agent write and execute Python code to perform tasks like:
    - Verifying factual claims from a web search?
    - Analyzing and summarizing data from a CSV file found online?
    - Generating data visualizations or tables to be embedded in the final report?
- **Output:** Provide a step-by-step integration plan and an example of how an agent's thought process would change with this new tool.

### 3.2. Efficiency and Cost: Batch Inference
- **Concept:** Our multi-agent system researches sections in parallel, but each call is a separate, real-time request.
- **Inquiry:** Can we leverage TogetherAI's **Batch Inference API**, which offers a significant cost discount? Outline an architectural change that would allow the `supervisor` agent to dispatch all research section tasks as a single batch job.
- **Output:** Analyze the trade-offs between real-time and batch processing for our use case. Provide a cost-benefit analysis comparing the two approaches, including the potential savings from the batch discount.

### 3.3. Improving Research Quality: Reranking and Embedding Models
- **Concept:** The quality of our reports depends on the quality of the initial search results.
- **Inquiry:**
    - **Reranking:** How can we integrate one of TogetherAI's dedicated **rerank models** into our pipeline? Show how this would fit between the "search" and "write" steps to improve the relevance of source material for the writer agents.
    - **Embeddings & RAG:** Propose a strategy for building a persistent, internal knowledge base from previously generated reports. How can we use TogetherAI's **embedding models** to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that allows agents to query our own content before resorting to external web searches?
- **Output:** For both points, provide a workflow diagram illustrating the proposed architecture.

### 3.4. Ultimate Customization: Advanced Fine-Tuning and Dedicated Endpoints
- **Concept:** Creating a truly unique and specialized model for our project.
- **Inquiry:** Go beyond basic fine-tuning. What would be the strategy for using TogetherAI's services to create a proprietary, domain-adapted model for high-quality report generation? This should cover:
    - A plan for full fine-tuning (not just LoRA) on a dataset of our best reports.
    - The benefits and costs of hosting this custom model on a **Dedicated Endpoint** for guaranteed performance and no cold starts.
- **Output:** Provide a project plan outlining the stages, from data preparation to deployment, with estimated costs and timelines.

### 3.5. Enhancing Reports: Multimodality
- **Concept:** Research reports are currently text-only.
- **Inquiry:** Propose a new, optional "Illustrator Agent" that could be added to our workflows. How could this agent use TogetherAI's image generation models (e.g., `FLUX.1`) to create visuals for the report, such as:
    - Conceptual diagrams to explain complex topics.
    - Data visualizations based on structured data in the text.
    - Stylized cover images for the report.
- **Output:** Describe how this new agent would receive its instructions and how its output would be incorporated into the final markdown report.

Please synthesize your findings into a structured report that presents a clear, data-driven case for adopting these advanced features, complete with implementation strategies.
